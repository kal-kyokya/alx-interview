# Star Wars API

This directory contains a Node script enabling manipulation of the Star Wars API as described below.

## Tasks To Complete
+ [x] **0. Star Wars Characters**

[0-starwars_characters.py](https://github.com/kal-kyokya/alx-interview/tree/main/0x06-starwars_api) This Star Wars API script prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:

* The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID:
	* Example: ```3``` = “Return of the Jedi”
* Display one character name per line ```in the same order as the “characters” list in the /films/ endpoint```
* One must use the [Star wars API](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com)
* One must use the ```request``` module

The “0. Star Wars Characters” project requires one to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument. To successfully complete this project, one needs to be familiar with several key concepts related to web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Concepts Needed:

### HTTP Requests in JavaScript:
* Understanding how to make HTTP requests to external services using the request module or alternatives like fetch in Node.js.

### Working with APIs:
* Understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them.
* Parsing JSON data returned by APIs.

### Asynchronous Programming:
* Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
* Handling API response data asynchronously.

### Command Line Arguments in Node.js:
* Using the process.argv array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.

### Array Manipulation and Iteration:
* Iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures to format and display character names.

By familiarizing oneself with these concepts, one will be able to efficiently retrieve, process, and display Star Wars characters from the specified movie using the Star Wars API, demonstrating ones ability to work with external APIs and manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.
